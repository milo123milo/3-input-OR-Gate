# 3-input OR Gate
Design and Implementation of a 3-input 220VAC to Digital Input OR Gate using ATtiny13A with Optocoupler Interface, Welding Protection, Dual Power Supply, and Voltage-Drop Detection Method: A Limited Knowledge Perspective
<br><br>
This paper presents the design and implementation of a reliable and cost-effective 3-input OR gate system for converting 220VAC signals to digital inputs. The system is based on an ATtiny13A microcontroller and employs an optocoupler interface for voltage isolation and protection. A voltage-drop detection method is used to determine if the 220VAC signal is on, allowing the microcontroller to accurately control the relay.
